Staging Area
Commit history
________________________________________________________________________________
intro :
	when we do git add file
		-> here the file is in staging area 
	when we do git commit 
		-> the file is in commit history
		-> when we do changers we have to commit it 
		-> commit is just a safe point 
	staging area + commit :
		-> this is happening in local machine 
	git push : send to remote server
		-> we need to do git push to store it in a remote server
		-> remote servers like : github, bitbucket ,aws code commit
	git pull
		-> hamid did a push to remote server 
		-> mariam can receive the changes by doing : \

git setup : configure git:
	-> git config --global user.name "zakariascode"
	-> git config --global user.email "set@zakariascode.com"
	-> git config --global color.ui auto  // enables commandline coloring output
	-> git config -e // to edit
	-> -l to list configurations
________________________________________________________________________________
git init: declare working dir as a git repo
	-> our working directory in our machine 
	-> we need to set it as a git repository
	 -int the working dir : 
		-> git init .


git status : gives status of changes made 
		-> telling about staging area status
	git add index.html : to stage
	git rm --cached index.html : to unstage
	git rm -r --cached . (. for all in current dir) :  to remove all

create a dir in working dir:
	mkdir test -> cd test -> touch test.js 
	-> now we are in test dir but if we check git status we don't found our file xD
	-> bu doing git add .
			=> we add only test.js
	-> by doing git add -A we add all xD
git commit:
	-> git commit -m "project XD"
	-> git status : nothing bcs the staging area is empty
	-> git log : to see commits 
		-> every commit have a hash code in top
		-> copy the code 
		-> git show hashCode
			=> to see more about the commit (what we added)
	-> to amend or change the message of a commit :
		-> git commit --amend -m "new change : body {} in main.css"

git diff (differences): in general not like git show
	-> see difference between what in working dir and what in staging area
	-> by doing git diff :
		-> ta7t @ atl9a + lines li tzado xD
git restore index.js : discarding changes
	-> restore to latest one (no changes)
git push :
	-> copy from our working machine to a remote server
github:
	-> platform for hosting and collaborating on git repos
	-> people can contribute with it
connect to github :
	-> git remote add origin https://github.com/Zakaria-Aboujenane/rappel-git.git
	-> git branch -M main
	-> git push -u origin main
		-> github changer branch from master to main xD
	->when doring git push -u they will tell u to enter account
	-> u can configure github account for SSh :
		-> goto : https://github.com/settings/keys
		-> https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
		-> follow steps for windows
